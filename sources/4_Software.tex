%Introduction Paragraph or two
The software team has begun looking into the coding of our project. With the test kit, we discovered that what was sent is not the same as the microcontroller we plan on using. This is a minor setback as we planned on being able to start coding sooner, but will now need to wait until we have components from our order to begin. For the time being, we have started a GitHub repository in order to track all our changes and collaborate on the coding. \par

\subsection{Algorithm}
We have been looking for the proper algorithm that would work with our project. So far we have found a few that seem to work great with what we want to do but have some cons. As of right now the ones that we have found are Dubins car path planning, Vector field histogram (VFH), A*(A-Star). From what we have read all of these algorithms seem to work great with path finding but the one that seems to be most effective is A* since the others tend to want to follow the shortest path but we want a set path to be followed. We have also started designing and preparing how we want our data base to look like for it to receive the information for the path to follow. \par
