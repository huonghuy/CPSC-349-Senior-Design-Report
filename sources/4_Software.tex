%Introduction
The software has been more complex than we thought, but we are mainly waiting for the materials list to arrive so that we can work with the ESP32 controller. We have the C++ code to move the motors with a joystick, but we have more that we want to do to map the room and retrieve the data. \par

\subsection{Algorithm}
On the Algorithm end, we have figured out that the SLAM Algorithm is too powerful for the microcontroller, so there is a version that works good for it called TinySLAM which we want to look more into it. we have to see how we can implement this algorithm for the code we have with the motors. \par
